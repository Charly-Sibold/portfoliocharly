A theme called Big Chill.

== Description ==

This theme features maximizing the use of images as a way to give a site a unique look.  
It does this by creating a layout that adapts well to a variety of different header videos and header images as well as background images.  
It also gives users the option to decide how to allow mobile browsers to utilize images and videos.  
Users may find that they can create a unique look by just uploading a video and a few images. 
Finally, it includes a sticky navbar and slidepanel menu for mobile browsers.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

2) The sidebar now stays parallel to the body.  It does not scroll parallel wih the footer.
This allows for improved compatibility with browsers.
3) The custom logo was rewritten to allow users to upload logos with more reckless abandon.
Cropping is no longer mandatory.
4) There are now options to set a larger text title above and below the navbar.
5) The default fonts and colors have been changed.
